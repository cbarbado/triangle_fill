# Triangle Fill
 
This is a very simple demo code to test and practice my JavaScript skills.

The challenge was to paint a given triangle, using only a setPixel() function, not painting the same pixel twice.

Just click the canvas 3 times to draw a triangle.
Click 3 times again to draw a new one.
Press the Clear button to clear the canvas.

Any comments and feedback are welcome!

Thanks for your interest. ;-)
